					<p> Striving to become a Front-end developer I also find passion on drawing, animation and creating visual stuff.
					Graduated in general studies and computer science who later realized that programing could be my future and I dicided to make it a career.
					Moved to the US from Ecuador in a young age and having worked in many jobs such as dishwasher, carwash, cook, paint/conctruction, etc, I decided to persue a career in technology even though I have no background related to that career, I simply knew that this was the future and i enjoyed learning it so I had to take the risk and I decided to leave college to attend a cooding bootcamp instead, so far I think it was the right decision I have made and I can already tell that the furure looks exiting.
